# Data Management Competency Assessment

This assessment evaluates my proficiency in data management, covering key competencies, areas for improvement, and future goals. Through coursework and personal initiatives, I have developed skills in data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), machine learning for prediction, and project planning.

## What I Know

**Competencies and Skills:**

-   **ETL Processes:** Proficient in extracting data from various sources, transforming it for analysis, and loading it into data warehouses using Python.
-   **Machine Learning:** Skilled in applying various algorithms using R Script to identify patterns and make predictions from data.
-   **Project Management:** Adept at planning, organizing, and executing data mining projects, as demonstrated by my website presentation:  [https://dpred.my.canva.site/](https://dpred.my.canva.site/)
-   **Technical Tools:** Proficient in Google Colab/Jupyter Notebooks for Python scripting and R Studio for R programming.

### Projects

**1. Diabetes Prediction using ML in R Script (GitHub):** [linked here](https://github.com/AdityaJagdale/Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-R-.git)

-   **Objective:** To predict whether an individual has diabetes based on a set of medical features.
-   **Process:**
    -   Data acquisition and preprocessing: Collected a dataset containing medical features (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure, BMI) and the corresponding diabetes diagnosis.
    -   Exploratory data analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential correlations.
    -   Model selection and training: Experimented with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) and selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
    -   Model evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-   **Outcome:** Developed a predictive model that could accurately classify individuals as having or not having diabetes, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

**2. Data Pipeline in Google Colab:** [linked here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1epQVvyoNm5m0L84noSlzqBJ_OTlVB05k?usp=sharing)

-   **Objective:** To demonstrate the ability to extract, transform, and load data using Python in a cloud-based environment.
-   **Process:**
    -   Data extraction: Utilized Python libraries like pandas to extract data from a specified source (e.g., CSV file, database).
    -   Data transformation: Performed data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation tasks as needed to prepare the data for analysis.
    -   Data loading: Loaded the transformed data into a desired destination (e.g., another file, database).
-   **Outcome:** Created a reusable data pipeline that can be adapted to various data sources and analysis tasks, showcasing proficiency in data management and Python programming.

## Where I'm Weak

-   **Big Data Management:** While not covered extensively in coursework, I recognize the increasing importance of big data technologies in the industry.
-   **Cloud-Based Data Warehousing:** My exposure to cloud-based data warehousing platforms like Snowflake and Amazon Redshift was limited. However, I have actively bridged this gap by taking online training to enhance my practical knowledge.
-   **Paper Writing and Exams:** I acknowledge the need to improve my writing and theoretical understanding in data management concepts, as assessed through traditional exams.

## What I Wish I Knew

-   **Big Data Processing Frameworks:** Learning frameworks like Hadoop and Spark would equip me to handle and analyze large-scale datasets efficiently.
-   **Advanced Data Warehousing Tools:** Knowledge of data warehousing tools like Snowflake and Matillion for ETL would further solidify my data management skillset.

These additional skills are valuable for staying competitive in the Data Management field, particularly roles requiring handling and processing large datasets and building complex data pipelines.

## Summary and Future Goals

I am confident in my ability to effectively manage data, demonstrated by my proficiency in ETL processes, machine learning classification tasks, and project planning. I am continuously motivated to improve and stay updated on industry trends. My future goals include:

-   **Data Warehousing Certifications:** Earning certifications in data warehousing, architecture, and ETL to become a Data Architect or Lead Data Engineer.
-   **Continuous Learning:** Utilizing online resources and courses to broaden my knowledge of big data processing and advanced data warehousing tools.

By taking a two-fold approach of acquiring theoretical knowledge and enhancing practical skills, I aim to solidify my foundation in Data Management and excel in future endeavors.

## Contribution Towards the Capstone

Data Management acts as the backbone for deriving value from data. Understanding data movement, transformation, storage methods, and security is crucial for successful data analytics and machine learning projects. My knowledge of these areas, coupled with my ETL skills, allows me to build data pipelines that empower various analytical tools and address diverse use cases. This comprehensive understanding will significantly contribute to the success of my capstone project.

Furthermore, my skills in data extraction, transformation, and machine learning classification will be instrumental in acquiring and preparing data for the capstone project. By carefully integrating these skills with other curricular areas, I can contribute to building a project that generates genuine value and showcases my ability to handle a complex data-driven project.
