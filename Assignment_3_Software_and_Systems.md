# Software and Systems Assessment
This assessment evaluates my proficiency in software and systems development, highlighting key competencies, areas for improvement, and future goals. Through coursework and practical projects, I have developed skills in data engineering, software development, project management, and technical communication. My ability to effectively design, develop, and maintain software systems will contribute significantly to the capstone project.

### What I Know

**Competencies and Skills:**

-   **Data Engineering:** Skilled in data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes (Matillion), data pipeline construction, and creating SQL stored procedures for data warehousing (Snowflake).
-   **Technical Documentation:** Adept at crafting clear technical documentation with tools like Lucidchart.
-   **Project Management:** Possess strong project planning skills (developed through [CIDM*6330 SOFT ENGIN/SYS DEVEL] coursework) and experience leading teams.
-   **Software Development:** Proficient in Python and familiar with Django frameworks.
-   **Teaching and Communication:** Demonstrate effective communication through technical teaching and presentations.
-   **Software Architecture:** Have a solid understanding of software architecture principles, evident in my ability to utilize diagramming tools (Lucidchart, Draw.io).

**Tools and Technologies:**

-   Programming Languages: Python
-   Data Warehousing: Snowflake
-   Data Orchestration: Matillion
-   Version Control: Git
-   Development Environment: VS Code
-   Diagramming Tools: Lucidchart, Draw.io

**Project Examples:**

-   **Data Warehousing and Data Orchestration:** Completed Snowflake Data Warehousing and Matillion courses, demonstrating the ability to build data pipelines and write SQL procedures for data warehousing.
-   **Competency Comparison App:** Currently working on a project to compare competencies using Django, HTML, CSS, and unit testing ([link to partial feature](https://github.com/AdityaJagdale/sessions_demo_c3t.git)). This project showcases proficiency in software development, project planning, and technical documentation.

### Where I'm Weak

-   **Client Relationship Building:** While I can communicate effectively in team settings, real-time engagement with clients in an in-office setting requires improvement. Limited opportunities during daily standups and refinement meetings restrict opportunities to build rapport.
-   **Refining Skills:** While proficient in core areas, continuous learning is crucial. Initially, Python, Django, and some research aspects required deeper understanding.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

-   Currently, in-office client interactions are limited, hindering relationship building. However, I seek opportunities to connect with team members who interact with clients more frequently.
-   Joining a project mid-way can present challenges in understanding ongoing workflows. My ability to adapt and learn quickly helped me overcome this obstacle in the competency comparison app project.

### What I Wish I Knew

**Cloud Technologies:** Gaining expertise in cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure would significantly enhance my software and systems development capabilities.

**Value for Data Analytics:** Cloud platforms provide:

-   **Scalability:** Ability to handle large-scale datasets efficiently, crucial for data analytics tasks.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Cost-optimized solutions for data storage, processing, and analytics.
-   **Advanced Services:** Access to cutting-edge cloud-based services for machine learning, data warehousing, and analytics.

By mastering cloud technologies, I'll be better equipped to manage complex data infrastructure and support advanced data analytics initiatives.

### Summary and Future Goals

I possess a solid foundation in software and systems development, evidenced by my data engineering skills, project management capabilities, and programming proficiency. My ongoing project demonstrates my ability to apply these skills in a practical setting.

For future development, I aim to:

-   **Pursue Cloud Certifications:** Earn certifications in GCP or Azure to validate my cloud expertise.
-   **Expand Programming Knowledge:** Further explore advanced Python functionalities and potentially learn another in-demand language like Java.
-   **Refine Soft Skills:** Actively seek opportunities to build client relationships and enhance interpersonal communication skills.

### Contribution Towards the Capstone

Data analytics relies heavily on software and systems to function effectively. My skills can contribute to the capstone project by:

-   **Building Data Pipelines:** Designing and implementing data pipelines to extract, transform, and load data for analysis.
-   **Developing System Components:** Constructing core functionalities of the capstone solution.
-   **Data Warehousing and Management:** Utilizing my knowledge of Snowflake and data warehousing principles to manage data efficiently.
-   **Integration with Other Systems:** Integrating the software with data analysis and visualization tools.

By leveraging my software and systems expertise, I can be a valuable asset in building a robust and scalable solution for the capstone project.
