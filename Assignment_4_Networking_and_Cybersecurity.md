This assessment evaluates my proficiency in networking and cybersecurity, highlighting key areas of strength, weaknesses to address, and future goals. Through coursework and personal projects, I have developed a solid foundation in risk assessment, security planning, digital forensics, and machine learning for anomaly detection. These skills are crucial for protecting data and systems within a data analytics environment.

## What I Know

### Competencies and Skills:

-   **Security Analysis:** Skilled in conducting security risk assessments, creating security plans, and auditing systems for vulnerabilities.
-   **Digital Forensics:** Proficient in applying machine learning and data analysis techniques for evidence collection, analysis, and reporting.
-   **Incident Response:** Possess knowledge of incident response procedures and contingency planning.
-   **Machine Learning:** Strong ability to build and tune machine learning models for fraud detection, as demonstrated in my project ([colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-1iOVxsgpJGXIqFIlzJw2SXI4mu8D8s9?usp=sharing)).

### Project Examples:
#### 1. Fraud Detection Project Project Overview:
The fraud detection project involved leveraging machine learning techniques to identify anomalous transactions that could potentially be fraudulent. By analyzing historical transaction data and identifying patterns associated with fraudulent activity, the model aimed to provide early warning signals to prevent financial losses.

**Key Steps and Contributions:**
**Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   -   Collected a relevant dataset containing transaction information, including features such as transaction amount, time, location, and customer details.
   -   Performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   -   Feature engineering: Created new features or transformed existing features to enhance model performance.
 
**Model Selection and Training:**
   -   Explored various machine learning algorithms suitable for anomaly detection, such as isolation forests, one-class SVM, or autoencoders.
   -   Selected the most appropriate algorithm based on factors like model performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
   -   Trained the model on a labeled dataset containing known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
  
**Model Evaluation and Tuning:**
   -   Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and false positive rate.
   -   Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model accuracy and minimize false positives.
   -   Conducted cross-validation to assess model generalization and avoid overfitting.
  
**Reporting and Visualization:**
   -   Generated clear and concise reports summarizing the model's performance, including key metrics, visualizations, and actionable insights.
   -   Developed visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices, ROC curves) to communicate findings effectively.

**Demonstrated Skills:**
-   **Data Analysis:** Proficient in data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering.
-   **Machine Learning:** Ability to apply appropriate machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
-   **Model Evaluation:** Understanding of evaluation metrics and their relevance in the context of fraud detection.
-   **Technical Communication:** Skill in presenting findings and insights in a clear and concise manner through reports and visualizations.

**Additional Insights:**
-   **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Fraudulent transactions often constitute a small percentage of the dataset, creating an imbalanced learning problem. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting can be employed to address this issue.
-   **Explainability:** Depending on the chosen algorithm, explainability techniques can be used to understand the model's decision-making process and identify key factors contributing to fraud predictions.
-   **Continuous Monitoring:** A fraud detection model should be continuously monitored and updated to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and ensure its effectiveness over time.

By successfully completing this project, I demonstrated a strong understanding of machine learning principles, data analysis techniques, and their application to real-world problems in the field of cybersecurity.

#### 2. Personal Risk Assessment Project:
Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential cybersecurity threats to my personal data and infrastructure. This included:
   -   Creating an inventory of assets.
   -   Assigning risk values based on severity and likelihood.
   -   Developing mitigation strategies and contingency plans.
   -   Implementing new security measures to improve overall posture. (While the specific details are confidential, this project demonstrates my understanding of risk assessment principles.)

## Where I'm Weak

-   **Asset Inventory:** While I can identify key assets, further experience is needed in creating comprehensive and detailed inventories within complex networks.
-   **Ethical Hacking:** I understand the importance of ethical hacking for identifying vulnerabilities, but hands-on experience is needed to effectively simulate real-world attacks.
-   **Network Monitoring Tools:** I am familiar with some basic monitoring tools, but further exploration of advanced tools and techniques is required.
-   **Theory and Writing:** Strengthening my understanding of theoretical cybersecurity principles and improving my ability to communicate complex concepts in writing will enhance my overall knowledge and professionalism.
-   **Quiz Performance:** While I am confident in my practical abilities, focusing on improving my performance in theoretical assessments can further solidify my understanding of key cybersecurity concepts.

## What I Wish I Knew

-   **Threat Intelligence and Analysis:** Learning how to leverage threat intelligence feeds and advanced analytics to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats would significantly enhance my ability to protect data and systems.
-   **Security Automation and Orchestration (SO&O):** Understanding and utilizing SO&O tools would improve efficiency and effectiveness in responding to security incidents.

**Value for Data Analytics:**

These skills are critical for data analysts who work with sensitive data. Threat intelligence helps protect datasets from breaches, SO&O streamlines incident response to minimize data loss, and advanced analytics allows for proactive detection of anomalous patterns that could indicate fraud or other security concerns.

## Summary and Future Goals
I possess a solid foundation in core cybersecurity concepts and can apply my skills to practical security tasks. My ongoing projects demonstrate my ability to learn new techniques and adapt to evolving threats.

**Future Goals:**

-   **Pursue Certifications:** Obtain certifications in security fundamentals (e.g., Security+).
-   **Ethical Hacking Training:** Participate in ethical hacking training to gain practical experience with penetration testing tools and techniques.
-   **Network Monitoring Expertise:** Expand my knowledge and experience with advanced network monitoring tools and techniques.
-   **Technical Writing Courses:** Enroll in technical writing courses to strengthen my communication skills.
-   **Stay Updated:** Continuously follow industry trends and stay abreast of emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

## Contribution Towards the Capstone

Data analytics projects often involve handling and storing sensitive data. My cybersecurity skills can contribute to the capstone project by:
